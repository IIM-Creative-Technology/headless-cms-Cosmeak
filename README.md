# Headless CMS course

In this course, we need to create a little portfolio with Nuxt3 for the frontend and Strapi for the headless CMS.


## Goals

1 - Base goals

- Made our own portfolio with IIM, company and personnal projects ✅
- Sort projects by type (with section)
- One page per project (use route params with project slug) with:
	- Project name ✅
	- Description ✅
	- Technologies used on the project (relation with technologies and projects in strapi) ✅
	- Useful link (if exist)
	- return back button ✅ 

2- Go further

- Typescript ✅
- Filter buttons on projects ✅
- On project page: Previous and next project button ✅
- Deploy project


## Setup

```bash
# Be careful to use yarn 3
yarn install
```

In services/strapi_ folder, copy-paste .env.example and fill it with your access.


## Launch project
You need to server:
```bash
# Backend with strapi
yarn strapi-dev

# Frontend with nuxt
yarn nuxt-dev
```
